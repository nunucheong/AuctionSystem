Austion System for Data Structure assignment year 1 semester 2

########check whether the .java classes you've finished are up to date with the one you saved in onedrive#############
- I made this git with the files in onedrive before 11/5/2016 so any upload made afterwards are not updated yet
- if there's any difference please use this as a chance to learn how to commit and pull request, then merge it with master branch
- anything just ask

############First thing to do when launching the GitHub:###########################
Sync everything first (top right on the desktop program)

Then commit the necessary files that you have altered.

Then click on pull request so that others are notified of your commit

Get verified and merge the branch into master branch
